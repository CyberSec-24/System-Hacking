-> Attackers use the hashcat tool to perform password attacks such as brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and mask attacks.

->  To perform mask attacks, an attacker must know the flags used for the built-in charset, custom charset, and attack mode to create an appropriate pattern for the password.

-> Attackers use the -m flag with hashcat to specify the hash mode, that is, the type of hash to crack, such as MD5, NTML, or SHA256.

-> -a → Specifies the attack mode, which is 3 here (brute-force attack) -m → Specifies the hash type, which is 0 here (MD5)

Example
-> Hashcat -a 3 -m 0 md5_hasheshashcat -a 3 -m 0 md5_hashes.txt -1 ?l?u ?1?l?l?l19?d?ds-1 ?l?u → Specifies that the character is either an uppercase or a lowercase alphabets.
